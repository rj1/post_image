# POST Image (Firefox extension)

this firefox extension allows you to right click an image and quickly upload i
to a file sharing service. right now uguu.se is supported, but the idea is to
allow users to customize the POST request so they can upload images to their
file sharing service of choice.

## todo

- allow users to change url/post parameters
- checkbox for open new url in browser
- checkbox for place new url in clipboard
